			<h2>The Game</h2>
			<p >Matches are contested by two teams of 15 a side, using a field 130m to 145m long and 80m to 90m wide. H-shape goals are used, a goal <i>(scored when the ball goes between the posts and under the bar)</i> is equal to three points and a point <i>(scored when the ball goes over the bar)</i> is equal to one point.</p>
			
			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>In 1932, twenty-eight years following the foundation of the Camogie Association, the first All-Ireland championship was played. The Tailteann Games of 1928 and 1932 whetted the appetite of players for competition of a higher standard than that provided at club level. Ten counties entered for the inaugural All-Ireland championship which was organised on an open draw basis. Mayo man, Sean O'Duffy, donated a silver cup, known as the O'Duffy Cup, for the championship.</p>
			
			<h3>Fashion and Style of Play</h3>
			<p>Players lined-out wearing gymfrocks that covered the knee, long black stockings, canvas boots, long-sleeved blouses and a belt or sash around the waist. The shape of the hurley lent itself to good ground strokes and the play was predominantly on the ground. A glance at the early scores shows that players concentrated on scoring goals. The majority of points registered came from placed balls.</p>

			<p>The Camogie All Stars Awards are awarded each November to the players who have made outstanding contributions to the Irish stick and ball team sport of Camogie in the 15 traditional positions on the field: goalkeeper, three full backs, three half-backs, two midfielders, three half-forwards and three full-forwards. They were awarded for the first time in 2003 as an independent initiative by a sponsor and then accorded official status by the Camogie Association in 2004.	<br/><br/>

				<h2>Differences between Camogie and Hurling</h2>			
				<ul>
					<li>Goalkeepers wear the same colours as outfield players. This is because no special rules apply to the goalkeeper and so there is no need for officials to differentiate between goalkeeper and outfielders. </li>
					<li>A camogie player can handpass a score <i>(forbidden in hurling since 1980)</i></li>
					<li> Camogie games last 60 minutes <i>(senior inter-county hurling games last 70)</i></li>
					<li>Dropping the hurley to handpass the ball is permitted.<i>(not allowed in hurling)</i></li>
					<li>A smaller sliotar (ball) is used in camogie - commonly known as a size 4 sliotar <i>(size 5 in hurling)</i> </li>
					<li>If a defending player hits the sliotar wide, a 45-metre puck is awarded to the opposition <i>(in hurling, it is a 65-metre puck)</i> </li>
					<li>After a score, the goalkeeper pucks out from the 13-metre line. <i>(in hurling, puck from the small square)</i></li>
					<li>The metal band on the camogie stick must be covered with tape. <i>(not necessary in hurling)</i> </li>
					<li>Side-to-side shoulder charges are forbidden. <i>(permitted in hurling)</i> </li>
					<li>Two points are awarded for a score direct form a sideline cut <i>(since March 2012)</i></li>
					<li>Camogie players must wear skirts or skorts rather than shorts.</li>
