			<h2>Stuff to Think About!</h2>
		
			<p>Despite the fact that we are supposed to be living in times where females have as much rights as males, some of the articles below prove that female sports stars have more challenges to contend with than the vigorous training and sacrifices they make to compete on a professional level.</p>
			<p><a href="#sharon">Sharon Whelton</a> says "It's about time females were duly recognised for their achievements in their respective fields of sport" in her article on female sports stars not getting the recognition they deserve may urge you to appreciate how hard our female sports stars have worked to have their achievements acknowledged. It is also thought-provoking that these women push themselves so much although this effort may not always be appreciated.</p>
			<p><a name="sharon" ></a><a href="#jere">Jere Longman</a> points out that female athletes have more to vie against than lack of public recognition. It appears that it's not enough to be a good athlete - you also have to look good while you compete! That is if you are allowed toccompete!! The next time you complain about training or that PE lesson think about the discrimination against female athletes in Saudia Arabia, where even physical education classes and sports club memberships are prohibited!</p>
			<p><a href="#eamonn">Eamonn Sweeney</a> questions whether Saudi Arabia should be allowed to participate in the Olympics given its attitude towards women participating in sport and points out that discrimination against women in sport has existed in the past in Ireland.</p>

					<p class="left"><b>Sharon Whelton</b> makes an observation that in this year's RTE Personality of the Year show, only ONE out of the ten nominees was female.  She points out that while Katie Taylor was recognised for her fantastic results in boxing again this year, her fellow female sports stars did not get the recognition they deserve.  She gives the example of the Cork Ladies Football team who have now won six All Ireland titles in seven titles, comparing the fact that the vast majority of people have not even realised what an unbelievable feat that the ladies had achieved with the response that the <a name="jere" ></a>Dublin senior footballers received when they brought the Sam Maguire home for the first time in years - media attention, as well as a slot on the Late Late Show.</p>  
					<p class="left">She also points out the lack of female representation in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year - in fact not ONE female athlete was nominated onto the shortlist. 	</p>

					<p class="left"><b>JERE LONGMAN</b> discusses the mixed messages being sent about women in the Olympics, some by women themselves.  Is more attention being paid to what they will wear and how they will behave rather than about how they will perform in competition?  An example is the ridiculous issue of the Officials of the Amateur Boxing Association suggesting that women try wearing skirts in competition because of complaints that spectators could not tell women from men beneath the protective headgear!! </p><a name="eamonn" ></a><p class="left"> Various examples are given of female sports competitors, such as beach volleyball player Zara Dampney and the Australian track and field team receiving more attention for what their bodies look like or they wear than for their athletic prowess!</p><p class="left">  A more serious issue is that of Saudia Arabia refusing to allow women to compete at London 2012 because the country bars women from sports, claiming it will lead to immoral behaviour.</p >

					<p class="left"><b>EAMONN SWEENEY</b> recalls how South Africa were banned from the Olympics for three decades on the grounds that its refusal to allow black athletes on its national teams contravened the Olympic Charter and questions why Saudi Arabia is still allowed to participate in the games despite excluding its women from international sport.  However the International Olympic Committee has not barred Saudi Arabia from the Olympics and are now trying to negotiate a shabby compromise by which Saudi women may be invited to the Olympics but will not be allowed to be part of their national team.</p><p class="left">  The article reveals that, according to the Human Rights Watch report, PE is forbidden for girls in state schools, most of the country's gyms for women were closed by the government two years ago, all of the country's officially licensed 153 sports clubs are closed to women and women are prohibited from attending sports events. He questions Saudi Arabia's right to participate in the Olympics but says that the IOC will not ban nations on good terms with the West despite excluding Afghanistan from the Sydney Olympics 12 years ago because of the Taliban government's discrimination against women in sport.</p><p class="left"> He also points out that there are still examples of discrimination against women in sport in the Western world citing the US Masters, an event taking place at a club in Augusta which refuses to admit women as members and questions why the golfing fraternity still seem to be cool with sexism.He points out the history of sexism in sport in Ireland where mixed athletics were banned in 1934 and points out that it was 1956 before an Irish female athlete, Maeve Kyle, competed in the Olympics.  </p>
